#E-Learning App

I coded this app for a group semester project in the subject "E-learning", which is part of my Bachelor Degree "Digital Media" at the University of Applied Sciences Ulm.

The task was to create a web app with HTML, CSS and JS for an Ipad Pro 12,9". We were free to choose the topic, but the app had to include materials for different learning types like auditory, visual, games, etc.
Due to the tight deadlines, the project was hardcoded for the given Ipad and was not made as a responsive app. I also used Bootstrap in orther to speed up the coding process.
